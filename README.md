# hello-claude

This repository serves as a demonstration project for testing the Claude Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with GitHub. The MCP allows Claude to interact directly with GitHub repositories, enabling capabilities such as:

- Reading repository contents
- Creating and updating files
- Managing issues and pull requests
- Collaborating on code changes

This example shows how Claude can assist with repository management and development tasks while maintaining context awareness of the GitHub environment.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to:
1. Test Claude's GitHub interaction capabilities
2. Demonstrate the practical applications of the Model Context Protocol
3. Serve as a reference for future MCP implementations

## Features

- Direct repository interaction through Claude
- Example of MCP integration
- Documentation of Claude's GitHub capabilities
