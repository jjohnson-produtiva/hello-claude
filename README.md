# hello-claude

This repository serves as a demonstration project for testing the Claude Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with GitHub. The MCP allows Claude to interact directly with GitHub repositories, enabling capabilities such as:

- Reading repository contents
- Creating and updating files
- Managing issues and pull requests
- Collaborating on code changes

This example shows how Claude can assist with repository management and development tasks while maintaining context awareness of the GitHub environment.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to:
1. Test Claude's GitHub interaction capabilities
2. Demonstrate the practical applications of the Model Context Protocol
3. Serve as a reference for future MCP implementations

## Features

- Direct repository interaction through Claude
- Example of MCP integration
- Documentation of Claude's GitHub capabilities

## Examples

The repository contains several example files demonstrating different aspects of the MCP integration:

### `examples/file_operations.py`
Demonstrates basic file operations such as creating, reading, and updating files through the MCP.

### `examples/github_operations.js`
Shows how to interact with GitHub APIs, including creating issues and pull requests.

### `examples/data_analysis.py`
Provides examples of analyzing repository data and generating insights.

### `examples/mcp_demo.ipynb`
A Jupyter notebook that combines various MCP features into a comprehensive demo.
